# Rhythm-Jam

The 21st RAP BATTLE Olympics are about to go down, and you're one of the top contenders.

Don't forget: EVERY RHYME MATTERS and you have to drop the best rhymes in order to take home the prize.

Every Rhyme Matters is a DDR-inspired rhythm game. Simply press the corresponding WASD/Arrow key to the beat. Blue notes damage your opponent while green notes heal you. Keep hitting the notes, so you don't freeze and drop the rhymes.

Audio and Lyrics: Mateus Pinho

Backgrounds: Martim Monis

Characters: Andreia Santos

Programming: Carlos  Marques and Paulo do Ã“
